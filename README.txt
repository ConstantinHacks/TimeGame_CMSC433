  Vaguely Inspired by the Duolingo quiz layout, this game teaches kids to read analog clocks.
  There are 30 questions asked, broken down into 3 10-level segments with increasing difficulty.
  The first (easy) level asks for time with minutes ending in either 0 or 5 and markations on the dial.
  The second (medium) level asks for time with minutes ending either 0 or 5 without the markations.
  The third (hard) level asks for time without any minute markations and any time.
  The player has 3 lives that regenerate between games.
  There are 4 audio clips that player after the following events: answer question correctly, answer question incorrectly,
  win game and lose game.

  Sound:
  As a thoughtful add-on, I have included sounds for added encouragement. These play after a correct or incorrect answer and when the player loses or wins the game.
